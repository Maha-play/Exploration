If you are not careful you may classify your audience into categories, and end up stereotyping them. This game is to help you recognize there are nuanced differences that you must consider when you ask yourself, “Who is my audience?”
The way to play this game is to explore your understanding of different terminologies we commonly use in society….
Let’s start with common categories we use when we think about our audience in terms of demographics. First up is [[Race]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Race" tags="" position="4,250" size="100,100">It is appropriate to define the audience based on the color of their skin, e.g. Black, White, or Brown.
[[True]]
[[False]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="True" tags="" position="200,179" size="100,100">If we categorize a person based on their skin color we may inadvertently stereotype them based on the color of their skin – that’s the definition of racist. Race is socially constructed concept based on color of skin; however, it does not define who the person is.

The ethnic background of a person who identifies as Black, growing up in America, is different from a person who identifies as Black, growing up in an African country, e.g. Ethiopia. Both are Black in appearance, but their heritage and cultural traditions are different.

The audience is 95% females, you think, “Great, #Me Too.”  Females will be more receptive to this speech…
[[True.]]
[[False.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="True." tags="" position="600,175" size="100,100">While the audience may be receptive to your message, defining the audience on the basis of sex is not right. When we categorize a person based on their sex we may inadvertently stereotype their actions on the bases of their sex – that’s the definition of sexist. Sex – being biologically male or female ignores gender identification.

Stereotyping the audience on the binary of male or female ignores the rainbow of gender identification; in other words, it disrespects how persons choose to be identified.

Now it is time to reflect on knowledge nuggets we picked up. Here’s the final task:
Advise a novice public speaker on things they should consider when it comes to audiences, highlighting what you learned. 
Guidelines:
One paragraph, about 100 words… This is a reflection – personal feelings, impressions and opinions, are welcome. Submit at assignment link “Game Time”.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
